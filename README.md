# TRex
Google dinosaur game develop in JavaScript.

## FAQ

Because your interface is simple (2D) and involve dynamics objects.

## Structural Elements

1. Terrain

**Cenery Movement** is the movement of objects and obstacle displayed.<br/>

I use the Canvas Element HTML for draw the images and TimeInterval to control the functions with different execution times. All develop was made for me learn the JavaScript code and improve my skills. You can use it for any propose.<br/>
The images were dimensionality in 50 x 50 pixels and the Canvas Element in 500 x 200 pixels.


The structure compose for:

+ **Groud layer** with 15 images
+ **Dinosaur** with 4 images
+ **Cactus layer** with 1 image

## Growth plan for the TRex project 

+ Performance optimization and code reduction.
+ Export the score for cloud.
+ Put the pterodactyl (bird) in the game.
